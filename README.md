## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes vendor and brand performance in the retail/wholesale sector to support better decision-making in procurement, pricing, and inventory management. Using Python, Jupyter notebooks, and supporting data files, it identifies opportunities to improve profitability, reduce inventory risks, and optimize vendor relationships.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Analyze** vendor and brand performance for data-driven procurement decisions.
- **Identify** underperforming brands and vendors to guide sales and promotion strategies.
- **Assess** inventory efficiency, bulk purchase impacts, and vendor concentration risks to reduce costs and risks.

## üìù Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are essential for maximizing profitability and reducing risks related to pricing, vendor reliance, and stock inefficiency. The project specifically aims to:

- Pinpoint low-performing brands for promotional or pricing adjustments.
- Identify major vendors impacting sales and gross profit.
- Measure effects of bulk purchases on unit cost.
- Evaluate inventory turnover to cut holding costs.
- Compare profitability differences between high- and low-performing vendors.

## üîç Key Insights

- **Top 10 vendors account for 65.69% of total purchases**, posing a concentration risk for supply chain dependency.
- **Bulk purchasing resulted in a 72% lower unit cost**, demonstrating significant cost savings for higher quantity orders.
- **$2.71 million worth of inventory had zero sales**, indicating potential excess or obsolete stock.
- Products with **negative or zero gross profit** highlight losses driven by discounting or inefficiencies.
- Low-performing vendors had **higher average margins (41.55%)** than top vendors (31.17%), but much lower sales volumes.
- Inventory turnover analysis suggests opportunities to improve cash flow and profitability by optimizing unsold stock.

## üìà Methodology

- Data was cleaned by filtering out loss-making and unsold items to focus on actionable insights.
- Statistical techniques included correlation analysis, outlier detection, and hypothesis testing to validate findings robustly.
- Visualization tools such as Python‚Äôs Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to illustrate trends and distributions (refer to included images or notebooks).

## üéØ Actionable Recommendations

- Re-price and promote low-selling but high-margin brands to improve turnover.
- Diversify the supplier base to reduce vendor concentration risk.
- Leverage bulk purchasing discounts to lower unit costs where feasible.
- Optimize management of slow-moving inventory through clearance sales or adjusted reorder quantities.
- Target enhanced marketing and sales strategies for vendors with low volumes but high profit margins.
